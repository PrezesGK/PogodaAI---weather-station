# PogodaAI---weather-station

PogodaAI is an open-source project that combines a solar-powered, modular weather and air quality station with a local AI model for pollution prediction.
The goal is to create a dense, affordable sensor network that supports communities and educational initiatives.


--- Features ---

☀ Fully autonomous – solar power + Li-Po battery (2–3 days autonomy)

- Modular design – easy sensor replacement or expansion

- Multi-sensor setup – PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity, pressure, VOC, wind, rain

- Wireless data transfer via ESP32 WiFi

- AI-based air quality forecasting using historical data

- Open source & DIY-friendly


--- Hardware ---

ESP32 (WiFi + low power modes)

PMSA003, BME680, YL-83, photodiode, custom 3D-printed anemometer & wind vane

Solar panel + Li-Po battery + charge controller

LCD 4×20 + keypad + SD card for local data logging

3D-printed PET-G weather-resistant housing with TPU gaskets

!!! CAD files, wiring diagrams, and BOM are provided in the hardware/ directory.


--- AI Model ---

Trained on open datasets (Edukacyjna Sieć Antysmogowa)

Predicts air quality based on 24h historical windows

Runs locally, lightweight & accessible

The whole AI model can be accessed at: ... WSTAW TU LINK

--- Why It Matters ---

PogodaAI enables local communities to monitor and predict air quality independently.
The system is affordable, modular, and open, making it ideal for education, research, and environmental action.
